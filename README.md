# webgl-skull-audio-visualizer
WebGL, Three.js and Web Audio API project, based on Dominic Hofacker work.

Separated skull into a head and a jaw. Made the jaw drop at the bass. Also made headphones shake at the bass.
Changed some of the code to ES6.

Web Audio API buffer is at 
webgl-skull-audio-visualizer/src/bufferloader.js

All the magic happens at
webgl-skull-audio-visualizer/src/audiovisualisierung.js
